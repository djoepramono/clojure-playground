# The setup

Clojure + Calva (VS Code Extension)

---

# An amazing REPL

Clojure has an amazing REPL, and Calva integrates with it well

# LISP

Stands for List Programming.

Everything in Clojure is Data

```
(+ 2 3)
```

that line of code above is actually a list

function is put before the argument

# Immutable once assigned

Once assigned data is immutable. 

However we can create a copy of the original data and modify it

---

# Functions

Functions in clojure can have different arity

---

# Recursion

Instead of loop, it uses recursion
