# Clojure Playground

A playground to experiment with Clojure.

If you are using Arch, like me then you can install Clojure by typing

```
yay -S clojure
yay -S rlwrap
```

Otherwise you might want to follow the [official guide](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure) on how to install it.

Start a REPL by running `clj` or if you just want to execute the main script `clj -M:run`
